            Commission on Elections (COMELEC) ensured voting accessibility and participation of vulnerable groups in the 2022 national elections through Resolution No. 10761 wherein Emergency Accessible Polling Places (EAPPs) will be established in voting centers catering persons with disabilities, senior citizens, and heavily-pregnant women.
            <br><br>
            An EAPP is a room or makeshift polling place established on the ground floor of voting stations where persons with disabilities, senior citizens, and heavily-pregnant women may vote on Election Day. It can also be put outside but still close to the voting center. According to COMELEC, there was one EAPP in areas with 1-7 barangays; two for those 8-14 barangays; and, three for those with 15 and above barangays.
            <br><br>
            COMELEC was commended by the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) for ensuring the safety and well-being of vulnerable individuals. Preventing risks and discomforts that may impede them from suffrage. They made sure that facilities and materials are appropriate, accessible, user-friendly, and easy to understand, as well as, reasonable accommodation.

                The two collisions happened during a routine Philippine resupply mission to Filipino troops stationed on a navy vessel that was grounded on the shoal to assert Manila's territorial claims.

            One significant obstacle to good governance in the Philippines is corruption. According to a survey of recent literature, the Philippines has a significant amount of corruption, ranging from minor bribes to grand corruption, patronage, and state control. Corruption has been combated through the implementation of legislative and institutional frameworks, as well as efforts by civil society organizations and the media. Donor agencies are also actively involved in increasing capacity to combat corruption in the Philippines. However, the success of these programs is far from certain. Many analysts feel that structural hurdles like entrenched corruption continue to impede anti-corruption efforts.

                    We, students from the Information Technology Field, are immersed in the current societal
                    problems. Our day-to-day activities are always keeping in touch with the latest news.
                <br><br>
                    We have chosen the problem of the current voting structure today, for it impacts not only
                    one nation but also the whole country itself. To have the right to vote is the exercise
                    of justice and balance in our country. Every vote we cast relies on the position
                    of authority to be given to that person, and having that position fall to someone incapable
                    of handling the position or role can cause our country problems.
